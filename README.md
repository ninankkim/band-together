Project Summary:
Band Together was created to help vulnerable populations find resources with the intentions to expand nationwide. When you access the website, the user will be directed to the homepage that will provide more statitics about the state of homelessness and hunger across the United States. By accessing the navigation bar, users can be directed to the find resources page where they can search for shelters, food pantries, and donation centers. In the find resources page, users can use the automated filter that can specify the quality of the resources. The find resources page also features a map that displays markers for correlate with the specific resource the user is searching for.
